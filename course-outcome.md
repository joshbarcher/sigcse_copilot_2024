# CS100 Assignment: Climate Change Analysis

## Part 1: Variables and Data Types
1. Declare two float variables named `temp_1990` and `temp_2020`, representing the average global temperatures in the years 1990 and 2020 respectively. Assign them any reasonable values.
2. Declare a float variable named `temp_change` and use it to store the difference in average global temperatures between 1990 and 2020.
3. Print the values of `temp_1990`, `temp_2020`, and `temp_change`.

## Part 2: Conditional Statements
1. Write a program that uses conditional statements to analyze `temp_change`.
2. If `temp_change` is greater than 0, print "The average global temperature has increased."
3. If `temp_change` is less than 0, print "The average global temperature has decreased."
4. If `temp_change` is equal to 0, print "The average global temperature has not changed."
5. Extend the program to also print a different message based on the magnitude of `temp_change` (e.g., if the temperature change is greater than 2 degrees, print a warning about significant climate change).

## Submission
Please submit your code files by the due date. Make sure your code is well-commented, explaining what each part of the code does.

## Grading
This assignment will be graded based on:
- Correctness of code
- Use of appropriate variables and data types
- Proper use of conditional statements
- Code readability and comments
